<center><i> Innumerous faeries of whim and whimsy who live in the heart of the wood </i></center>

# Overview
The Fey Folk, or faeries, refers to innumerable [[axiomatic mortals]] created by [[Titania The Muse]], including notably Gnomes, Pixies, and Sprites.

Faeries live in glades and woods throughout [[Kaloshen]] in a romanticized ideal of a chivalric court. They are flaky and changeable, working on a logic that doesn't always make sense to other races. Some faeries attempt to control their mercurial nature by swearing to an ideal.

# Identity

## Homeland
Faeries have a single homeland, called [[Hoshi Hall]], that has no central location and is scattered throughout the world. [[Titania The Muse|The Summer Queen]] has, by means not understood, linked the deepest heart of every wood, such that they all share a single space, and serve as doorways to her realm. Spirits are easily manifested in [[Hoshi Hall]] and many live alongside the Fey Folk.

The landscape surrounding [[Hoshi Hall]] is ever changing, and sometimes travellers travelling the realm of the faeries can find themselves in forest, hills, and plains unknown to [[Kaloshen]], with strange people and animals. This mysterious landscape is known as [[Hoshi Hall#The Backwoods|the Backwoods]].

| freedom of expression, creativity, pursuit of an ideal | Personal stagnation, over commitment, limiting ones potential, forced choice |
Fey Folk have a much less religious view of [[The Fundamentals]] than most [[axiomatic mortals]], treating them more as honored royalty than deities. Conversely, faeries have a stronger spiritual connection with [[Spirits]] than most other races, and consider each spirit a minor god.

### Heart's companions
Faeries have a natural affinity for [[Spirits]] which hold a position of great respect in their culture. Faeries consider themselves the link between [[Spirits]] and other [[axiomatic mortals]], and will often take the will of [[Spirits]] into account in major decisions. Fey folk who are particularly devoted to an ideal that aligns with a [[Spirits|Spirit]], or have done a great service to a [[Spirits|Spirit]], can win that [[Spirits|Spirit's]] loyalty and brotherhood for life, and be named a Heart's Companion. Being named a Heart's Companion is one of the highest honors a fey folk can achieve, and Heart's Companions often serve as spiritual leaders in a community.

### Revelries
Revelries are ritualistic parties thrown by Fey Folk to empower and embolden the spiritual energy of a region (and also have a good time!). Huge bonfire are burnt with effigies of local [[Spirits]] doused in wine and packed with food thrown onto the conflagration in worship. Dancing and singing is done all throughout the night, and sacrifices of all sorts are made to the [[Spirits]]. [[Spirits]] will declare their Heart's Companions during a Revelry, and ideals and commitments are often sworn during the night.

### Mana Healing
Fey Folk believe in a spiritual practice called Mana Healing in which one's [[Breath]] is bolstered with the [[Breath]] of a [[Spirits|Spirit]] to strengthen natural healing. Individuals with a strong Green [[Breath#Colours & hue|Hue]] to their Breath are the best Mana Healers, but with a powerful [[Spirits|Spirit]] even those with a different Hue can perform a Mana Healing.
Although true Mana Healing is rarely needed, it has become common practice for faeries to seek "little" healings to drive away colds, ease bumps and bruises, and even attempt to cure minor melancholy or mania. In such cases, non-expert Fey Folk will perform pieces of the Mana Healing rituals with their local or household Spirit nearby. The efficacy of "little" healings is disputed by scholars, but rarely by Fey Folk.


## Language

## Organization
Faeries operate in a chivalric monarchy that is, in essence, a caste system. The Noble Houses in [[Hoshi Hall]] own no land, command no armies, nor hold great wealth. They were simply created by [[Titania The Muse]] with the intention that they be Nobles, and so they are. [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] will, on occasion, assign or revoke seemingly random and nonsensical duties to different Noble Houses, such as "suppression of seditious behaviour from the shrubs", or "mustering of an armed force of watercolour squirrels". Despite their outwardly irrational status, the Nobility of [[Hoshi Hall]] are just as conniving and Machiavellian as any other court, and the ever shifting Houses are constantly vying for power and orchestrating the fall from grace of their rivals. [[Titania The Muse]] seems to relish creating and destroying Noble titles, and has a keen eye for both sycophants and rebels.

### Heralds: the Oberons
The Heralds of [[Fey Folk]] are the Prince/Princess consorts of [[Titania The Muse]], and always adopt the name Oberon. [[Titania The Muse|The Empress]] is fickle, her desires ever changing, and thus the number and identity of the Oberons is in constant flux. Male or female, noble or peasant, one or many, [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] appoints and removes Oberon's as she wishes. When more than one Oberon is in vogue, [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] will usually append a moniker to the title, naming them "Oberon the Tall" or "Oberon the Artist" or "Oberon the Loud Sneezer". The Summer Queen has often said she does this for others, as she can "always tell" which one *she* means.

Oberon is treated by [[Hoshi Hall]] as if they were a true regent. They declare new laws, hold royal court, lead armies, and make lavish use of the treasury. Oberon is a title that grants ultimate power in [[Hoshi Hall]] second only to [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] herself, and even the nobility play along, hoping no doubt for their turn.

The title of Oberon also comes with a divine mandate: to add novelty to the world. Oberon's have heralded the death of monarchs, been the muse to inventors and artists, summoned catastrophes that have shaped the landscape, and other no doubt lesser know day to day changes. Leaving [[Hoshi Hall]] on a self-imposed exile to change the world is in fact a relatively reliable way to hang on to the title of Oberon, as Titania has been less likely to remove an Oberon when they aren't top of mind.
