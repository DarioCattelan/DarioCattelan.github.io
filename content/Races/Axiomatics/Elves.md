# Overview
Elves are [[axiomatic mortals]] created by [[Elenwe The Farmer]]. Elves are born [[Perpetuals]], they can be killed by violence but stop aging once they reach maturity. Elves have a deep regard for the seasons and things that grow, and their cities are often found surrounded by ancient trees, tall mountains, or arable fields.

Elves have a timeless perspective that other ancestries find confusing or frustrating. They are slow to act and have the luxury of waiting for an ideal moment that can come decades or centuries later.

Elves relish long, complex ceremonies and rituals.

### The Mutacurir
The mutacurir (Moo-tah-KOO-reer) is a special time of day personal to every elf that marks the start of an important daily cycle. The event marking each elf's mutacurir can vary widely from person to person, and some examples include the hour of their birth, their last meal of the day, the break of dawn, etc. Either directly before, after, or during the mutacurir, faithful elves perform a repetitive ritual prayer, called the alkhawat (al-ka-WAT), typically taking around an hour to complete. Practitioners attempt to perform the alkhawat in the exact same way over and over, with precision and endurance bringing the faithful closer to divinity.

The mutacurir can be modified during certain elvish religious holidays, sometimes setting a specific time for the mutacurir for the whole community, or other times changing the duration or steps of the alkhawat,

With the exception of the zealous and orthodox, it is not necessary for an elf to observe the mutacurir at the exact same hour every day. Rather, it is generally accepted the the alkhawat should occur in general proximity to the event marking the mutacurir. Penance for missing the alkhawat varies from culture to culture, but accidental or inadvertent skipping of the alkhawat is typically resolved by doubling the time spent on the alkhawat during the next mutacurir.

### Cilcilafcur
Cicilafcur (sill-sill-aff-KOOR) is a term which refers to organized the ancestral chain of authority from child to parent of the elves (stretching all the way to [[Elenwe The Farmer]]), as well as the ritualized act of seeking wisdom from that chain. When reaching certain momentous or novel life milestones, elves will typically seek cilcilafcur with a parent or elder for guidance. If the parent or elder is unable to advise from their own lived experience, the elder will turn to their parent or ancestor, with the theoretical potential for the question to reach all the way to [[Elenwe The Farmer]]. In practice, it is rare for the routine life of elves to require cilcilafcur beyond a single generation.

The exact nature of the rite of cilcilafcur varies from generation to generation, but primarily involves a set of ritualistic questions repeated many times followed by a period of shared meditation between the asker and elder. Some groups employ mystical herbs and incense during the rite, others may require the meditation to be undertaken in a sweat lodge or sauna. Generally, the rite is less complex for younger generations of elves, and more complex for older generations.

## Language
Elves speak, read, and write elvish. Elvish is an elegant language of soft consonants and vowels with an almost musical tonality. Elvish script is looping, serifed, and symmetrical, and whole words are written without lifting the quill from the page. Elvish script refuses to be carved, engraved, or tattooed on plants or animals.

## Organization
Elves are organized in a republic gerontocracy with the Majilis as its head of state. Elves' economic system relies primarily on an agrarian indentured worker based system, where wealthy landowners of elite clans control the economic and political power over a small merchant and tradesman middle class, and a large indentured working peasantry. This system was functional before [[Mothers' Heresy]], when elves had a non-motile, low-wage [[Halflings|Halfling]] plebian population, but since [[The Freewalk Accords]] the middle class has steadily grown larger and land owning elite are struggling to turn a profit from farm that must pay their labourers.

### The Majilis
The Majilis (ma-GEE-leess) is a republican senate lead by [[Elenwe The Farmer]] serving as perpetual High Tari which rules over the elves. The Majilis is organized into four parties of decreasing political power, whose eligibility is determined by generation. Each party's membership is determined in theory by election, however, the parties of the High Tari and Projidi have such limited eligibility that no election is needed. Election occur for the Jidi and Alwadi each season, and with such regularity in voting pattern that they are more formality than true political race. There are 128 seats in the Majilis.

#### High Tari
The High Tari (tah-REE) serves as the speaker of the Majilis, head of state, and high consul. It is only ever filled by [[Elenwe The Farmer]]. The station carries power of veto, can assign and revoke time on the floor, and enforces decorum in the Majilis.

#### Projidi
The Projidi (pro-GEE-dee) are the eldest members of the [[Rasul clan]] who serve as [[The Heralds]] of [[Elenwe The Farmer]]. The Projidi hold 65 or the 128 seats of the Majilis, giving them a majority on any vote, and requiring at least one Projidi to support any law being passed. The members of the Projidi are often divided on the political spectrum, and Projidi votes are hard to predict.

#### Jidi
The Jidi (GEE-dee) are elected from elves who are at least great-great grandparents and members of land owning elvish clans. The Jidi hold 40 of the 128 seats of the Majilis, a large minority, and are an important political force for any action that requires bi-partisan involvement. The Jidi are traditionally socially conservative.

#### Alwadi
The Alwadi (al-WAH-dee) are elected from elves who are at least grandparents and members of land owning elvish clans. The Alwadi hold 20 of 128 seats of the Majilis, and as a result provide only minor political sway. Political families often use the Alwadi as training grounds for their career in the Jidi. The Alwadi are much more socially liberal than the Jidi.

#### Arwah
The Arwah (AHR-wha) are two spirits who volunteer to be in the Majilis. They hold two seats, the Seat of Flora and the Seat of Fauna. the Arwah hold far too few seats to pass any legislation, but each seat has a seasonal power of veto. Members of the Arwah are flaky by nature, and representatives do not always sit all season (though the Seat of Flora is much more likely to sit encumbered for a whole season). The Arwah voting patterns are mercurial and unpredictable, and other parties make great effort to secure the Arwah veto each season.
