# Overview
Elves are [[axiomatic mortals]] created by [[Elenwe The Farmer]]. Elves are born [[Perpetuals]], they can be killed by violence but stop aging once they reach maturity. Elves have a deep regard for the seasons and things that grow, and their cities are often found surrounded by ancient trees, tall mountains, or arable fields.

Elves have a timeless perspective that other ancestries find confusing or frustrating. They are slow to act and have the luxury of waiting for an ideal moment that can come decades or centuries later.

Elves relish long, complex ceremonies and rituals.

### The Mutacurir
The mutacurir (Moo-tah-KOO-reer) is a special time of day personal to every elf that marks the start of an important daily cycle. The event marking each elf's mutacurir can vary widely from person to person, and some examples include the hour of their birth, their last meal of the day, the break of dawn, etc. Either directly before, after, or during the mutacurir, faithful elves perform a repetitive ritual prayer, called the alkhawat (al-ka-WAT), typically taking around an hour to complete. Practitioners attempt to perform the alkhawat in the exact same way over and over, with precision and endurance bringing the faithful closer to divinity.

The mutacurir can be modified during certain elvish religious holidays, sometimes setting a specific time for the mutacurir for the whole community, or other times changing the duration or steps of the alkhawat,

With the exception of the zealous and orthodox, it is not necessary for an elf to observe the mutacurir at the exact same hour every day. Rather, it is generally accepted the the alkhawat should occur in general proximity to the event marking the mutacurir. Penance for missing the alkhawat varies from culture to culture, but accidental or inadvertent skipping of the alkhawat is typically resolved by doubling the time spent on the alkhawat during the next mutacurir.
