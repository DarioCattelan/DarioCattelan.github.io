# Description
## Preferred Form
Tall woman wearing layer upon layer of strung coloured beads, forming a draping cover somewhere between a dress and a poncho, such that her arms and legs are unseen.
She has thick cranial platting like an orc, long floppy goblin ears, and a cascade of frizzy black hair tied in a hobgoblin bun. Her shell has a swirling pattern of ivory and dark grey. Wherever she touches there lingers a mark of her passing.

- Oneness: within a Link in [[The Ordning]], all things are equal. This belief was added by the [[Mothers' Heresy|Mothers' Heresy]] .
-  Community: each being's highest calling is to contribute to the wellbeing of those in the same Link in the Ordning
- Distinction: Each being's uniqueness is to be encouraged and incorporated into the diversity of the Link
