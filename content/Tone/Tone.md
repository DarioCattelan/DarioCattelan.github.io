# **1. Emotional Tone**

### **Gentle, even when heavy**

Moments of violence or sorrow are present, but seldom sensationalized. There’s a softness to how difficult things are portrayed.

### **Melancholy, not despair**

Ghibli sadness is wistful—about loss, change, growing up, or the past—without ever giving up hope.

### **Quiet wonder**

A sense of awe expressed through small moments: a spirit emerging from a bathhouse towel, a gust of wind lifting a paper charm, a bird’s shadow overhead.

### **Emotional sincerity**

Characters react to magic with earnestness rather than cynicism. Fear, joy, curiosity, and confusion all feel raw and unfiltered.

# **2. Aesthetic Tone**

### **Lush, lived-in worldbuilding**

Worlds feel tactile: cluttered homes, mossy shrines, creaking machinery, forest humidity, steam from kitchen pots.

### **Nature as presence, not backdrop**

The world is _alive_—spiritually, ecologically, symbolically. Even urban spaces pulse with unseen forces.

### **Whimsy with gravity**

Creatures and magic often appear strange or humorous, but carry emotional or mythic weight (e.g., soot sprites, kodama, turnip-head).

### **Visual quiet**

Long pauses, still shots, slow pans, and “ma” (purposeful emptiness) let the audience breathe.

# **3. Narrative Tone**

### **Dream logic**

Worlds operate by symbolic or emotional rules rather than strict systems. Magic feels intuitive more than explained.

### **Ambiguous morality**

Very few pure villains. Conflicts come from clashing needs, not evil intent—e.g., humans vs. forest gods, resentful spirits, war’s unintended harms.

### **Transformative journeys**

Not “chosen one” power fantasies, but journeys of maturity, empathy, courage, or grief processing.

### **Everyday life treated as sacred**

Cooking, cleaning, traveling, doing chores, meeting someone new—these are shot with the same reverence as battles or magic.

### **The extraordinary intertwined with the mundane**

A walking castle might creak like a real old house; a bathhouse for gods has shift supervisors and staff problems.

# **4. Spiritual Tone**

### **Animist worldview**

Everything has spirit or intention: rivers, buildings, animals, memories. This creates emotional stakes that aren’t about power but about relationship.

### **Reverence for the past**

Ruins, old forests, forgotten gods, and abandoned objects are treated with emotional significance.

### **Mystery embraced**

Some things are never explained, and that openness is part of the wonder.
