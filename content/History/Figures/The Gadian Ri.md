<center><i>The worlds greatest thief, the tax collector, the Perpetual Herald</i></center>

The Gadian Ri (Gah-DEE-un REE) is both the name and title of the dwarven Herald of [[Dwemeran The Collector]]. He is Kaloshen's greatest thief, and the tax collector for [[The Fundamentals]]. There has only ever been one Gadian Ri, as they are a [[Perpetuals|Perpetual]]. It is unclear if their perpetual abilities are granted by their station as Herald, or if they were chosen as Herald due to perpetual abilities.

## Heraldic Duties
Unlike most Heralds, the Gadian Ri performs some services for all [[The Fundamentals]], acting as divine tax collector for the Gods. As such, the Gadian Ri is rarely in the realms of the dwarves, and their presence is seen as an ill omen, a superstition no doubt encouraged by their secondary role as [[Dwemeran The Collector]]'s thief.

Being the Herald to the god of hoarding and preservation, the Gadian Ri has a divine mandate to add new and fascinating items to [[Dwemeran The Collector]]'s grand treasury deep in the depths of the earth. Not even [[The Fundamentals]] can shift the stubbornness of Dwarves, however, and it has become an accepted tradition for dwarven Kings and Queens to refuse their finest items as tithe. When such irresistible treasures are not given willingly to [[The Gadian Ri]], they are taken by larceny, stealth, and skullduggery. It is widely accepted in both myth, religion, and common knowledge that [[The Gadian Ri]] is [[Kaloshen]]'s greatest thief.
