The Freewalk Accords is the peace treatise that marked the end of [[Mothers' Heresy]]. The accord was made between the [[Orlins|Orlin]] and the other [[axiomatic mortals]] , and declared that no axiomatic race would have legal hegemony over another. As part of the peace deal, the accord returned of most of the ancestral lands of the [[Halflings]], and gave any Halfling freedom to emigrate to their newly gifted territory.
