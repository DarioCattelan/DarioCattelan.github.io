#magic #Breath

Breath is the innate, magical power creatures contain within. Everyone has Breath, though some individuals (such as powerful mages or warriors) have Breath in much greater quantities than others. One's Breath can grow as they develop, and even change Hue.

# Colours & hue
Breath comes in eight colours, and most people's Breath is a mix with one dominate colour, called a Hue.

## The Eight Colours
The eight colours of Breath are each associated with a different quality. It was by refining a Breath to a moment of a single, pure Hue that the [[Primeval bloodlines]] were able to derive the eight schools of magic.

| Colour | Description               | School of magic |
| ------ | ------------------------- | --------------- |
| Purple | The Breath of movement.   | Conjuration     |
| Violet | The Breath of strength.   | Abjuration      |
| Blue   | The Breath of the senses. | Illusion        |
| Green  | The Breath of vitality.   | Necromancy      |
| Yellow | The Breath of knowledge.  | Divination      |
| Amber  | The Breath of thought.    | Enchantment     |
| Orange | The Breath of adaptation. | Transmutation   |
| Red    | The Breath of energy.     | Evocation       |
