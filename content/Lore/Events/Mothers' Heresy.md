Mothers' Heresy was a series of overlapping wars waged by the [[Orlins]]  to enforce civil rights and liberties to the [[Halflings]] by providing them their own territory.

# Edict of Axiomatic Equality
Following  [[Grastus the Free]]'s [[Orlins#The Enlightenment of Axiomatic Equality|Enlightenment of Axiomatic Equality]], the Orlin underwent a civil war which resulted in the Orlin adopting a religious imperative for the personal liberty of all [[axiomatic mortals]]. Failing to persuade the neighbouring [[Dwarves]] and [[Elves]] to release their portion of the ancestral lands of the [[Halflings]], and provide freedom of movement to their national populations, the Orlin invaded.

## The Scouring
During Mothers' Heresy, the [[Orlins|Orlin]] army systematically burned numerous ancient woodlands as a strike against the [[Fey Folk]] and their [[The Fundamentals|Fundamental]] [[Titania The Muse]]. This act, more than any other during the war, wreaked havoc on the [[Spirits]] of [[Kaloshen]] and forced the [[Fey Folk]] to capitulate to Orlin demands.

# The Freewalk Accord
After several notable battles, the Orlins seized huge swath of territory from their adversaries, liberating thousands of Halfling. The other nations were forced into a peace agreement with the Orlin, whereupon the Orlin would return seized lands in exchange for the majority of the ancestral land of the [[Halflings]] and free passage to any Halfling who wished to return home.
