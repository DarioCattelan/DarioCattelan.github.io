# Speakers
Orlish is the language spoken, written, and read by [[Orlins]]. It is a complex language full of exceptions and contradictions, but relatively easy to learn by other races as it draws many roots from [[Low Sylvan]], [[Elven]], and [[Dwarven]].

# Script
Orlish uses a system of layered glyphs for everyday meaning, with many similarities to simplified [[Dwarven]]. 21 of the glyphs, called the *Standard Set*, have a dual meaning, representing both a word as well as a phonic. The Standard Set, when used phonetically, can be strung together to form words for complex written communication.

# Phonics
Orlish is spoken with many pauses and sudden stops, inviting conversation. It has many sounds formed deep in the chest, making it an easy language to shout.
