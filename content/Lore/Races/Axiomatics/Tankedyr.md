Tankedyr are prone to intense natural urges, and are more intense in their cravings and emotions than other races.

Tankedyr have no national identity, and are organized in a series of free mercantile city states.

Tankedyr worship [[Graedor The Merchant]] in a monotheistic religion which promises eternal comfort in the afterlife to the faithful.
