<center><i> Innumerous faeries of whim and whimsy who live in the heart of the wood </i></center>

# Overview
The Fey Folk, or faeries, refers to innumerable [[axiomatic mortals]] created by [[Titania The Muse]], including notably Gnomes, Pixies, and Sprites.

Faeries live in glades and woods throughout [[Kaloshen]] in a romanticized ideal of a chivalric court. They are flaky and changeable, working on a logic that doesn't always make sense to other races. Some faeries attempt to control their mercurial nature by swearing to a virtue.

# Identity

## Homeland
Faeries have a single homeland, called [[Hoshi Hall]], that has no central location and is scattered throughout the world. [[Titania The Muse|The Summer Queen]] has, by means not understood, linked the deepest heart of every wood, such that they all share a single space, and serve as doorways to her realm. Spirits are easily manifested in [[Hoshi Hall]] and many live alongside the Fey Folk.

The landscape surrounding [[Hoshi Hall]] is ever changing, and sometimes travellers travelling the realm of the faeries can find themselves in forest, hills, and plains unknown to [[Kaloshen]], with strange people and animals. This mysterious landscape is known as [[Hoshi Hall#The Backwoods|the Backwoods]].

## Traditions & Beliefs

| Values                                                 | Anti-values/Sins                                                             |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| freedom of expression, creativity, pursuit of a virtue | Personal stagnation, over commitment, limiting ones potential, forced choice |
Fey Folk have a much less religious view of [[The Fundamentals]] than most [[axiomatic mortals]], treating them more as honored royalty than deities. Conversely, faeries have a stronger spiritual connection with [[Spirits]] than most other races, and consider each spirit a minor god.

### Non-monogamous Unions
Fey folk do join in formal unions for life, but the unions are not usually monogamous. Marital union to faeries is a the public declaration of a personal, ultimate loyalty, devotion, and partnership, but it is not expected to be a fey folk's *only* partnership. Divorce is allowed and encouraged, but is not as frequent as one might think, for even after a century there is always something novel to be found in a loved one. Polygamy is not uncommon amongst the peasantry, but is rarer in the Nobility.

### Spirit feeding
[[Spirits]] are more likely to manifest in [[Hoshi Hall]] than in other regions of [[Kaloshen]], and can be made to manifest permanently if fed food and alcoholic drink by the faeries. It is unclear why food and drink will corporealize a [[Spirits]], not even by the [[Spirits]] themselves who are often shocked at finding themselves incapable of dissipating their essence. Often, a Sylvan will be consulted before feeding any spirits, and the fey folk make great efforts to convey the consequences of consumption to [[Spirits]], but misunderstandings do happen. A happily fed Spirit is a huge boon to a faery house, and can lead to recognition as Nobility.

### Virtues
Fey folk are mercurial and flaky by nature, but inversely revere the totemic embodiment of a concept or phenomenon by [[Spirits]]. Fey folk who are strong of will, with guidance from a Sylvan, can swear themselves to the pursuit of a Virtue, a standard or principle by which they will live their life. A Virtue represents some change a Fey Folk wishes to see in the world, and often involves the will of [[Spirits]]. Virtues are not necessarily defined or achievable, and many Virtues are aspirational concepts. Some example Virtues include "The end of a long sorrow", "The growth of a great wood", "The rising of a new sun", etc.

### Heart's companions
Faeries have a natural affinity for [[Spirits]] which hold a position of great respect in their culture. Faeries consider themselves the link between [[Spirits]] and other [[axiomatic mortals]], and will often take the will of [[Spirits]] into account in major decisions. Fey folk who are particularly devoted to a Virtue that aligns with a [[Spirits|Spirit]], or have done a great service to a [[Spirits|Spirit]], can win that [[Spirits|Spirit's]] loyalty and brotherhood for life, and be named a Heart's Companion. Being named a Heart's Companion is one of the highest honors a fey folk can achieve, and Heart's Companions often serve as spiritual leaders alongside Sylvans in a community.

### Revelries
Revelries are ritualistic parties thrown by Fey Folk to empower and embolden the spiritual energy of a region (and also have a good time!). Huge bonfire are burnt with effigies of local [[Spirits]] doused in wine and packed with food thrown onto the conflagration in worship. Dancing and singing is done all throughout the night, and sacrifices of all sorts are made to the [[Spirits]]. [[Spirits]] will declare their Heart's Companions during a Revelry, and Virtues and commitments are often sworn during the night.

### Mana Healing
Fey Folk believe in a spiritual practice called Mana Healing in which one's [[Breath]] is bolstered with the [[Breath]] of a [[Spirits|Spirit]] to strengthen natural healing. Individuals with a strong Green [[Breath#Colours & hue|Hue]] to their Breath are the best Mana Healers, but with a powerful [[Spirits|Spirit]] even those with a different Hue can perform a Mana Healing.
Although true Mana Healing is rarely needed, it has become common practice for faeries to seek "little" healings to drive away colds, ease bumps and bruises, and even attempt to cure minor melancholy or mania. In such cases, non-expert Fey Folk will perform pieces of the Mana Healing rituals with their local or household Spirit nearby. The efficacy of "little" healings is disputed by scholars, but rarely by Fey Folk.

## Language
Fey Folk speak two primary languages, [[High Sylvan]] spoken by Nobles and [[Titania The Muse|The Empress]], and [[Low Sylvan]] spoken by the peasantry. Travellers who have journeyed to [[Hoshi Hall#The Backwoods|the Backwoods]] sometimes return speaking [[Dark Sylvan]].

## Organization
Faeries operate in a chivalric monarchy that is, in essence, a caste system. The Noble Houses in [[Hoshi Hall]] own no land, command no armies, nor hold great wealth. They were simply created by [[Titania The Muse]] with the intention that they be Nobles, and so they are. [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] will, on occasion, assign or revoke seemingly random and nonsensical duties to different Noble Houses, such as "suppression of seditious behaviour from the shrubs", or "mustering of an armed force of watercolour squirrels". Despite their outwardly irrational status, the Nobility of [[Hoshi Hall]] are just as conniving and Machiavellian as any other court, and the ever shifting Houses are constantly vying for power and orchestrating the fall from grace of their rivals. [[Titania The Muse]] seems to relish creating and destroying Noble titles, and has a keen eye for both sycophants and rebels.

### Chivalric Hierarchy
Below are the noble rankings in [[Hoshi Hall]]. The rankings come with no additional title, land, or wealth, and are merely descriptions of the noble's favor with [[Titania The Muse]]. Despite this, the titles do carry real power in [[Hoshi Hall]].

| Title                        | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Empress                      | For [[Titania The Muse]] only, the absolute monarch by divine right                                                                                                                                           |
| Oberon                       | Consort of [[Titania The Muse]], regent with absolute authority barring intervention or contradiction by Titania.                                                                                             |
| Duke/Duchess                 | Nobles with extreme favor and pull with the Empress. Often fleeting. Can exert nearly total control over other Fey Folk.                                                                                      |
| Lord/Lady Chevalier          | Noble in strong favor with the Empress. Can almost always get what they want without question.                                                                                                                |
| Knight/Dame of a Color       | E.g. Green Knight, Violet Knight, etc. Noble in moderate favor with the Empress. Can often get what they want without question, sometimes requiring pageantry and shows of strength.                          |
| Knight/Dame of a Beast/Plant | E.g. Knight of the Thistle, Knight of the Hawk. Noble in waning favor with the Empress. Can sometimes get what they want without question, often requiring pageantry and shows of strength.                   |
| Unnamed Knight/Dame          | Lowest Noble, not recently acknowledged by the Empress and frequently in the employ of Dukes and Chevaliers. Often treated deferentially, but can exert little influence without support from upper nobility. |



### Sylvans
Sylvans as [[Spirits]] who have manifested permanently in [[Hoshi Hall]] and have chosen to serve as spiritual leaders to faeries. Sylvans have a role outside of the Chivalric Hierarchy, and are treated with respect, if not deference, by all nobility. Sylvans advise faeries on pursuit of their Virtues, perform healings, divine auguries, sanctify companionships, and perform at revelries.

### Heralds: the Oberons
The Heralds of [[Fey Folk]] are the Prince/Princess consorts of [[Titania The Muse]], and always adopt the name Oberon. [[Titania The Muse|The Empress]] is fickle, her desires ever changing, and thus the number and identity of the Oberons is in constant flux. Male or female, noble or peasant, one or many, [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] appoints and removes Oberon's as she wishes. When more than one Oberon is in vogue, [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] will usually append a moniker to the title, naming them "Oberon the Tall" or "Oberon the Artist" or "Oberon the Loud Sneezer". The Summer Queen has often said she does this for others, as she can "always tell" which one *she* means.

Oberon is treated by [[Hoshi Hall]] as if they were a true regent. They declare new laws, hold royal court, lead armies, and make lavish use of the treasury. Oberon is a title that grants ultimate power in [[Hoshi Hall]] second only to [[Titania The Muse|Titania]] herself, and even the nobility play along, hoping no doubt for their turn.

The title of Oberon also comes with a divine mandate: to add novelty to the world. Oberon's have heralded the death of monarchs, been the muse to inventors and artists, summoned catastrophes that have shaped the landscape, and other no doubt lesser know day to day changes. Leaving [[Hoshi Hall]] on a self-imposed exile to change the world is in fact a relatively reliable way to hang on to the title of Oberon, as Titania has been less likely to remove an Oberon when they aren't top of mind.

# Biology
Fey folk are extremely diverse biologically. Fey folk are not [[Perpetuals]], but some can live several centuries, while others live a handful of decades.

Not all pairings of fey folk can produce viable offspring, and some fey folk reproduce asexually.

All fey folk have a difficult time metabolizing alcohol, but this does not stop them from enjoying it.

# Relationships
Fey folk are confused by the traditionalism of [[Dwarves]].

Fey folk are drawn to the natural devotion and the cyclical nature of [[Elves]], but can grow bored of their endless repetition.

Fey folk are fearful of [[Orlins]], remembering [[Mothers' Heresy#The Scouring|the Scouring]].

Fey folk find [[Halflings]] adorable, and are willfully ignorant of their own history in regards to Halfling apartheid, for [[Titania The Muse]] bade they move their thoughts to newer delights.
