<center><i> The Three-fold People who's communal bonds define their lives</i></center>

# Overview
Orcs, Hobgoblins, and Goblins are different [[axiomatic mortals]] created by [[Orthal The Mother]], called Orlin. Chitinous and hearty, the Three-fold People, as they are sometimes called, live in large communal hives made of stone and a natural bile made in their stomachs.
Each race once served as a caste in the hive communities, but no longer. Ever since the [[Mothers' Heresy]] several generations ago, the Orlin live in a communist system without formal hierarchy.
# Identity

## Homeland
The Orlin live in arid steps and dry deserts too harsh for most other mortals. Orlins form large communal houses in a handful of huge termite-like calcified mounds, called Hives. The plaster that makes these Hives is the result of a biological process unique to Orlin which allows them to mix sand within a specialized second stomach and regurgitate it as a fast hardening cement slurry.

The Orlin are strong believers in [[The Ordning]], a "Great Chain of Being" religion where all things on [[Kaloshen]] fall into a hierarchy of divinity.

Ever since [[Mothers' Heresy]], the Orlins have a strong belief that all axiomatic mortals are equal, and any act that seeks to place one individual above another of the same [[The Ordning#Ordning Links|Ordning Link]] is seen as heretical and a sin.

### Mundane Magical Practices
#### The Perpetual stew
Orlin communities will often have a form of magical, perpetual stew brewing in the communities [[Orlins#The Herald Home|Herald Home]].


## Language
Orlins speak, read, and write [[Orlish]].

## Organization
Orlin leadership is complex and administrative, with no formal state executives, and three Heralds serving as religious and cultural leaders. Orlin live in a communist socio-economic system, with administrative roles appointed by rotating lottery lead by committee. All land is community owned, and private wealth can be seized and redistributed at any time by the one committee or another.

### Heralds
Orlins have three Heralds who's membership is always composed of one Orc, one Goblin, and one Hobgoblin. Heralds are appointed by divine mandate by the Mother herself, typically for life. The Mother announces her choice of Herald to all Orlin directly by magical means, and no Herald has ever refused the appointment.
In theory, the Heralds' serve solely as advisors and spiritual leaders, providing guidance on religious matters and bridging the will of the Mother and the Orlin. In practice, the Heralds serve as ultimate oversight on the practices of the many governing committees of the Orlin, and have been known to intervene when committee members stretch their authority too far. Such instances have lead to quick and zealous action.

#### The Herald Home
Every Orlin community will have a Herald Home, which serves as both living quarters for any local or visiting Heralds, as well as a community center. [[Orlins#The Perpetual stew|The Perpetual Stew]] of the Orlin is typically kept brewing in the Herald Home.

# Relationships

## Relationship with spirits

## Common misunderstandings with outsiders

# Biology
Orlin typically live 70-80 years, and mature faster than humans reaching adulthood in their middle teens. Orlin have several insect-like features that invites allusion to termites or beetles. 

## Shells
Orlins have a Keratin shell over the soft dermal layers of their skin. The colour of their shells can range from soft pastel blues and pinks, to deep rich greens and oranges. Orlins molt their shells several times a month when in childhood, but this growth slows down and stabilizes in adult life. A typical Orlin will only molt once or twice a year after reaching full maturity.

## Crud
Orlins have the unique ability to produce a cement-like expulsion, called crud, by mixing sand, dirt, and bile from a second specialized stomach. Orlin builders will ingest large quantities of fine sand along with several other catalytic tonics and potions, and regurgitate the crud in large piles. For several hours the crud will remain malleable and tacky, but will slowly dry into a hard, brittle cement-like substance. Professional Orlin builders, trained in the skill over several years, can produce up to 5 times their bodyweight in crud a day.

## Sex
As children of the God of unity and division, Orlin are sexual dimorphic, but have the ability to switch sex at time of molt. Most Orlin spend time as both sexes during their childhood, and switching between sexes often is encouraged during adolescence. Adult Orlin typically settle for long periods in a single sex of their choosing and convenience, but it is not at all unusual to find Orlin who regularly switch sex throughout their entire life.

Orlin reproduce via externally fertilized eggs, and are compatible within the Three-fold people. An Orlin emerges from its egg after 6 months of incubation, at a stage of infancy capable of short ambulatory movement and non-sense babbling. An Orlin egg can be fertilized by more than two parents, and it is possible for an Orlin infant with the parentage of two different Orlin races be born of the third Orlin race.

# History
## The Edict of Axiomatic Equality
In date [[Grastus the Free]] was appointed Herald of the Mother, replacing his still living predecessor. Immediately upon taking office, [[Grastus the Free|Grastus]] was granted epiphany [^1] by the Mother on the nature of a hierarchy within [[The Ordning#Ordning Links|Ordinal Links]]. Previous dogma from the Mother had given a ranking within each Link, but this new edict declared all beings within a Link equal in all ways. What followed was civil upheaval, including several violent uprisings. The forces of the [[Fartuk Bloodline]] were ultimately defeated by Grastus' [[Three People's Army]], enacting the edict as law, and dissolving the [[Fartuk Bloodline]]'s Divine Monarchy and the Orlin race based caste system.


## Mothers' Heresy
The Orlin, under the urging of the Mother Herald [[Grastus the Free]], started the series of wars which would eventually be called the [[Mothers' Heresy]]. Following [[Grastus the Free]]'s declaring the edict of axiomatic equality in the Links of [[The Ordning]], the Orlin Committee of Foreign Unity, and the Committee of Forced Physical Division agreed to enact the edict by crusade. The Orlin invaded the neighbouring Dwarvish and Elvish territories, freeing Hafling lands as they went. After several notable battles, the other races were forced to sue for peace, returning most of the ancestral lands of the Haflings.

## The Relationships
Dwarves and Elves dislike Orlins for [[Mothers' Heresy]], which was several generations ago for the Orlin but still fresh in the minds of the long lived races.

Halflings are very hospital to Orlin for their liberation, but still hold the generational trauma of servitude under the Three-fold people from before the [[Edict of Axiomatic Equality]].
