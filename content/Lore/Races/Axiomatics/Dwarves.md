# Overview
Dwarves are [[axiomatic mortals]] created by [[Dwemeran The Collector]]. Dwarves believe that the first of their kind were built by [[Dwemeran The Collector]] out of perfect clockwork. Nobody knows how Dwarves reproduce, and discussion of the subject is strictly taboo.

Dwarves dwell deep in the earth where they can better hear the songs and whispers of the stones. The status, wealth, happiness, and health of a dwarf can be gauged by the size of their hoard, for all dwarves have in their nature the compulsion to gather, collect, and hide objects and knowledge.

# Identity

#### Mountainhomes and Royalburrows
Dwarves live in feudal communities of fiefs ruled by pseudo-hereditary clans. The seat of power where the regional Dwemer[^1] rules is referred to as either a Mountainhome or Royalburrow, depending on if the hoard vault is above sea-level for the former, or below for the latter. Each fief has arable land for farming, either on the surface or in subterranean caverns, as well as veins of rich ore and a hoard vault provided by the crown. Dwarves typically feel a strong sense of kinship and loyalty to their Mountainhome or Royalburrow, and the seats of power define cultural boundaries as much as political ones.

### The Hoard
Dwarves are avid collectors of knowledge, treasure, and what other races might call "random junk". Dwarves always know the exact size in volume, weight, and market value of their hoard, and often compare with other dwarves. Many factors are used to evaluate a hoard, and the value of a hoard directly influences a dwarfs social status and position. Though counter intuitive to other races, a dwarven Dwemer[^1] does not have the largest hoard of the region because they are Dwemer, they are Dwemer *because they have the largest hoard*.
A dwarfs hoard can have a profound, magical effect on their health and biology. Dwarves who lose a large portion or "crown jewel" of their hoard can quickly deteriorate into serious illness. Likewise, the addition of a wonderful new bit of lore or precious object to a hoard can bolster a failing dwarf into health.
Obsession with a hoard can lead a dwarf down a dark path. Several notable dwarves have "fafnired" throughout history, submerging themselves in their hoard, forgoing food and drink, sustaining themselves solely on the magic of the hoard. If friends and family do not separate a dwarf from their hoard in time, they can undergo an irreversible biological transformation, transforming into a loathsome wyrm or dragon.

### Thastus' Innovative Method
For true dwarven self-actualization, one must not simply collect large amounts of knowledge and resources, but must actively use this wealth to craft and create. The highest form of this practice is to craft something truly innovative using [[Thastus' Innovative Method]] (TIM), a rigorous form of craft-dwarfship that requires careful documentation, testing, and peer review. Only once a new method or idea has undergone the full TIM process do Dwarves feel comfortable accepting new, innovative ideas over tried and true traditional methods. Finding peers for the TIM process can be difficult, and many Dwarves are forced to travel far and wide from their holes in order to find acceptable expert reviewers.

## Traditions & Beliefs

| Values/Virtues                                          | Anti-values/Sins        |
| ------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| Ownership, materialism, knowledge, tradition, invention | Theft, debt, iconoclasm |


### Stone Songs
Knowledge and secrets are just as valuable to any dwarven hoard as rare metals or gems. For many dwarves, this necessitates travelling up out of their burrows into the world beyond, but to some gifted in stonemagic, they can gather secrets and lore from the stones themselves.

### Shrines and Monuments
Dwarves worship spirits and [[Dwemeran The Collector]] by constructing shrines and temples. The size and craft-dwarfship put into the shrine is in itself an act and sign of devotion. Dwarves believe that building a shrine *creates* the spirit that resides within it. Dwarves, believing that they themselves were created by [[Dwemeran The Collector|Dwemeran]], see this as a divine act, and shrine builders are themselves a caste of dwarven priest.

### Mundane Magical Practices
#### Magical Crafts
When enough time and care is spent crafting something, it takes on minor magical properties, regardless of whether active enchantment was done. None know this better than the dwarves, and everything from the dinnerware they eat with to the clothes they wear hum with a low level magic.

## Language
Dwarves speak read and write [[Dwarven]], a deep, resonate language. 

## Organization
### Dwarven Feudalism
Dwarves have a feudalist socio-economic system directly based on ownership of hidden vaults and mining veins, and indirectly based on the value of a dwarfs hoard. 
#### Origins
The dwarf who has the highest value hoard commands a biologically and sociologically driven respect from their peers, and necessarily requires the region's most secure and secret vault as storage. Over millennia of hoarding, the greatest vaults have developed networks of castles, strongholds, dungeons, and armies to secure their wealth and treasures. As hoards are typically passed on through hereditary succession, power families arose as vaults were kept and expanded by the same bloodline for generations.
Eventually, these bloodlines had such complex networks of ever expanding vaults, they were unable to fill them all with the contents of their hoard, and struggled to maintain the ones that were filled. The practice of gifting unused vaults to vassal houses as fiefs started to emerge, with promises of servitude exchanged for security. As the practice was internalized by dwarven tradition, the head of a ruling family became a monarch called a Dwemer[^1].
#### Dwemer rule and fiefs
The seat of power where the Dwemer rules is [[Dwarves#Mountainhomes and Royalburrows|the Mountainhome or Royalburrow]] with the greatest vaults. From their seat of power, the Dwemer is the legal owner of all the vaults and ore veins in the region, protected and enforced by a standing security force. The majority of a regions "army" comes from the strength of arms of surrounding vassals, who will pledge loyalty to the crown in return for an allotment of a vault. The Dwemer is intimately familiar with the security and weaknesses of all the vaults in their realm, and can maintain control over their vassals with this implied threat.
#### Succession
A Dwemer is almost always succeeded by their first born child through absolute cognatic primogeniture. In situations where the Dwemer does not have any children, or they have legal grounds to believe their children will put the royal hoard at risk, they can enforce a horizontal seniority succession to their eldest living sibling.

In rare cases, Dwemer have been succeeded by divitiae tanistry, passing the throne to a vassal who has collected a far more valuable hoard than the ruling house. In such cases divitiae tanistry takes precedent over all other forms of succession, but the buyer beware, for the inheritance tax collected by [[The Gadian Ri]] can be astronomically large in such cases, and has left new monarchs in precarious positions.

### Heralds: The Gadian Ri
The Dwarves have a single Herald: [[The Gadian Ri]]. The Gadian Ri is both title and name of the [[Perpetuals|Perpetual]] holder. Unlike most Heralds, the Gadian Ri performs some services for all [[The Fundamentals]], acting as divine tax collector for the Gods. As such, the Gadian Ri is rarely in the realms of the dwarves, and their presence is seen as an ill omen, a superstition no doubt encouraged by their secondary role as [[Dwemeran The Collector]]'s thief.
Being the Herald to the god of hoarding and preservation, the Gadian Ri has a divine mandate to add new and fascinating items to [[Dwemeran The Collector]]'s grand treasury deep in the depths of the earth. Not even [[The Fundamentals]] can shift the stubbornness of Dwarves, however, and it has become an accepted tradition for dwarven Dwemers to refuse their finest items as tithe. When such irresistible treasures are not given willingly to [[The Gadian Ri]], they are taken by larceny, stealth, and skullduggery. It is widely accepted in both myth, religion, and common knowledge that [[The Gadian Ri]] is [[Kaloshen]]'s greatest thief.

# Biology
Dwarves live long lives deep underground, surviving 320-350 years. Dwarves are shorter than Elves and Orcs, but taller than Haflings and Gnomes, standing typically around 120 - 150 cm. They are stout and muscled, weighing 180-340 lbs when healthy.

## Hoard admiration
Dwarves have a biological imperative to desire, admire, and respect a fine collection of items and lore. It is typical for dwarves to learn the value of another dwarf's hoard should they become acquaintances, and shift their social dynamic to reflect a hegemony, with the more valuable hoard owner being on top.

## Hoard Fever and Fafnir transformation
Dwarves hoarding impulse can sometimes run out of control during times of extreme stress, referred to as hoard fever. Should a hoard reach a critical "Fafnir point" while a dwarf is experience hoard fever, they will retreat to their main vault and submerge themselves in the hoard. Drawing sustenance from the magic of the hoard itself, a dwarf will forgo food, drink, and company to stay in the hoard. If they are not removed from the vault, the dwarf will undergo Fafnir Transformation, a process by which the dwarf pupates into a wyrm or dragon. The personality of the dwarf is all but lost to avarice post-transformation, and it is considered a mercy (and a fantastic opportunity to add to your hoard) to slay the fafnired dwarf.

## Sexual morphism
Dwarves are sexually dimorphic, but can exhibit such subtle differences that other races struggle to identify female and male dwarves. All dwarves are capable of growing beards, have deep baritone voices, and stout hips and frame. Dwarves are mammals, but dwarflings need not drink milk for proper growth and can grow just as healthy suckling on a variety of minerals (called milk-salts) found deep within the earth. As such, many dwarfs prefer he/they or she/they pronouns, and some dwarven cultures consider gender a very personal secret.

## Reproduction
Nobody but mature dwarves know how dwarves are born. It is the highest taboo to discuss reproduction in dwarven culture, and dwarves cannot produce viable offspring with any other [[axiomatic mortals|axiomatic race]]. Scholars of other people's have yet to definitively record the birth of a dwarf, and there are numerous rumors and myths as to how it is done.

# History



# Relationships
Dwarves dislike Orlin for their communal approach to ownership and their aggression during [[Mothers' Heresy]]. Dwarves are often in conflict with Elves over the mining of mountains or chopping of forests for dwarven works and projects.
