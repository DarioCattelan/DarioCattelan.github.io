# Description
Titania is a [[The Fundamentals|Fundamental]] corporeal deity who rules over [[Fey Folk]] as Empress. She is constantly creating new [[axiomatic mortals]], who are collectively referred to as [[Fey Folk]].

## Preferred Form
A beautiful, tall woman with ruby red lips and snow-white skin. Her hair and eye colour are ever changing, and her garb switches to suit. She bears large, gently fluttering butterfly wings, and atop her head sits a crown of the finest silver.

## Emotional State
Erratic. Switches unpredictably. Roll a d20 for Titania's mood at any given time.
