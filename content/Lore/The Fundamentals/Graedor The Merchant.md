# Description

## Preferred Form
A huge, fat bear with a mane of feathers and a wolf's maw. His fur is shaggy and rouse, and bears faint stripes. He is dressed in luxurious gold and azure silk trousers held up by a dark leather belt, straining to withhold his girth behind a gold buckle depicting a sunning snake, and soft elegant moccasins of gold. He wears no shirt, and holds a rose-gold scepter bedecked with jewels and wrapped plushily in fabric at the handle. He rarely stands, carried about in a palanquin stuffed with feathered pillows.
